# brain-tumor-detection
brain tumor detection by machine learning techniques
this program is used to early detect brain tumor 
we used a numerical data set for patients how actually have brain tumor to train and test the program
we used many ML algorithmis as Decision Tree','Naive Bayes','Perceptron','KNN'and 'Random forset'
